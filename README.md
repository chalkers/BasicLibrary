#BasicLibrary for Arduino

##Introduction

This is a basic object orientated library for Arduino that consists of the following classes:

* `DigitalPin`
* `AnalogPin`

Both `AnalogPin` and `DigitalPin` instances start in the off state. 

###DigitalPin 

`DigitalPin` allows you to create a digital `OUTPUT` pin on a given pin number. It has three methods `on()`, `off()` and `write()`.

Call `on()` so set the pin to `HIGH` and `off()` to set it to `LOW`. 

The `write()` method takes a value of `true` (`1`, `HIGH`) or `false` (`0`, `LOW`) to manually switch it on or off.

####Example

    #include <DigitalPin.h>
    
    DigitalPin forward(13);
    DigitalPin backward(12);
    
    void setup(){
    }
    
    void loop() {
     backward.off();
     forward.on();
     delay(1000); 
     forward.off();
     backward.on();
     delay(1000);
    }

###AnalogPin 

`AnalogPin` allows you to create a PWM `OUTPUT` pin on a given pin number. It has three methods `increase()`, `deacrese()` and `setIntensity()`. The `setIntensity()` method takes a value between `0` and `255`.

Call the `increase()` and `decrease()` methods to increase or decrease the `_intensity`  values of `51`. This means that there are 6 unique values, `0`, `51`, `102`, `153`, `204` and `255`. Calling `increase()` on the pin when the `_intensity` is `255` will not increase it further. Calling `decrease()` on the pin when the `_intensity` is `0` will not decrease it further.

The `setIntensity()` method takes one parameter, an `int` to manually set the `_intensity`. If the value is greater than `255` it will be set to `255`, anything less than `0` it will be set to `0`.

####Example

The following example will darken an LED on pin `12` until it switches off completely. On pin `13` an LED that is off initially and will get brighter until it gets to the value of `255`.

    #include <AnalogPin.h>
    
    DigitalPin brighten(13);
    DigitalPin darken(12);
    
    void setup(){
		darken.setIntensity(255);
    }
    
    void loop() {
     brighten.increase();
     forward.deacrease();
     delay(250);
    }
